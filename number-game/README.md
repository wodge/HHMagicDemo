# number-game
Number guessing game - Python 3.
I am new to programming and this is the first project that I have tinkered with. If there are more efficient ways to do what I am doing, please let me know! 

Source-code.txt is the original code that I wrote while figuring out loops and statements, etc.

number-game.py is a refined version using a class.

Need to write code to read in high score list, update it with new high score and keep top three.
